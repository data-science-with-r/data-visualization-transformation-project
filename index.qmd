**Research Question (1)**: Is there a relationship between the distance (in miles) someone travels in a taxi, and if they tip or not? Does this relationship change if the taxi ride is on the weekend (Sat; Sun) vs the weekday?

**Research Question (2)**: Do taxi passengers tend to tip more for the company Chicago Independents than the other companies?
